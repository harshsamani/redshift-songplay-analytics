# Project Overview
This repository contains an ETL pipeline designed to load and transform data into the Sparkify database hosted on AWS Redshift.

## Table of contents
- The goal of this database is to help Sparkify gain valuable insights into user behavior, such as the types of songs users prefer, the artists they listen to, and patterns in user activity based on log and file data. 

- By centralizing and structuring this information in a consistent database, Sparkify can better address a variety of business questions.
